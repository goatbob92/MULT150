 Is the game too easy or hard?
       - The game is too easy in that the player can just sit there and wait and it will be over 
       pretty quickly. However, the game is also too hard in that the player is mostly unable to 
       hit the balls at any point, rather they just bounce around until they end up at the target.
 What would make it easier or harder?
        - The game could be made harder and easier, more playable, by changing the speeds of the 
        balls on certain intervals, giving the player chances to hit the balls and also making 
        times when they are much faster and harder to hit. Also, making a default movement speed
        for the player that is faster than the normal walking speed would make the game more playable.
 What would give it a "wow" factor?
        - The game's "wow" factor could be based off the randomness of the balls movement, maybe adding
        power-ups or randomly triggered events that change the visuals or targets. Also a time limit on
        winning the game could make it more exciting to play.
 What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
        - The part of the game that is fun is the visuals and the bouncing of the balls, however 
        actually conrolling the paths of the balls is tedious and not very enjoyable at the
        current state of the game.


SUGGESTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
- Try adding variations of the chaos balls. --> Added random speeds and sizes, also changing colors
- Try adding a timer so that the player knows how long it took to win --> Took a spin on this, adding 
    a countdown from 30 seconds, if the player does not win in that time, the game ends.
- Try adding a chaos goal that you must bounce all the chaos balls into --> Self explanatory
- Try changing the size or shape of the player's bumper --> Made the bumper smaller and rounded (collider still a box, aesthetics)

NOTE: Got rid of the water as it didn't fit in with my vision of the game, left it on the outside as
decor for if the player peeks over the walls.
